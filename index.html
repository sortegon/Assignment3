		<p class="blurb">A quick and easy guide for those who live in or near Tampa, Florida and like to grow vegetables.
		Florida can be a tricky state for growing vegetables. Extreme heat, drought, flooding, and sandy soil can all be challenges for the average Joeâ€™s backyard garden. Here are just some tips on growing vegetables in each season. Keep in mind that the Hillsborough County UF/FIAS Extension office not only has resources available to residents, but they offer community classes too!</p>

<!-- Student Feedback:
	*Making the content such a large part of the grade made it difficult to concentrate on good programming techniques. I chose a topic I was interested in but don't know much about so I spent much more time than I should have researching and making sure that my content was relevant and made sense. 
	* The recommended sites for reading about HTML and CSS felt dated. There are some websites that teach the material much more fluidly (i.e. w3schools.com). I learned much more easily on these other sites and felt that the recommended sites did not prepare me for building a well-designed site.
	*Assignment took me approximately 10 hours total (Not including the time it took to learn concepts used)-->
